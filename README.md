# Hospital-Database-SQL

## Overview
I took a Database System Design and Management course and created a database project with a team.
This project involves designing and implementing a hospital database. With Oracle, I used SQL for queries scripts, Data Definition Language (DDL) for creating tables, and Data Manipulation Language (DML) for inserting, updating, and querying data. The database efficiently organizes and manages hospital information, ensuring seamless operations and easy retrieval of patient, staff, and medical data for streamlined healthcare management.
